# Learning Outcomes 
During this diploma I studied these topics:
  1) Advanced C programing, data structure and algorithms. 
     - These certificates were obtained from Hacker Rank: (https://www.hackerrank.com/certificates/a6e63e1eb7bc)
  2) Microcontroller interfacing: many device drivers have been written for PIC18F family like: GPIO, interrupt handling, ADC, EEPROM, UART, I2C and SPI. These projects have been implemented during this part:
    - Traffic Control  : In this project multiple modules have been used like: LED, and Seven segment .
    - Joystick wheelchair  : In this project multiple modules have been used like: LCD, Bush button, L298 and external Interrupt .
    - EUSART using receiver and transmitter : In this project two modules have been used like: EUSART, and LED .
    - Autonomous driving of a 2 wheel car : In this project multiple modules have been used like: LCD, Buzzer, L298, and               ultrasonic sensor.
    - Security system password check : In this project multiple modules have been used like: LCD, Buzzer, LED, and Keypad .
    - Simple calculator : In this project two modules have been used like: LCD, and two types of Keypad .
    - Smart Home System: Multiple microcontrollers communicate over the I2C protocol. In this project multiple modules have been used like: 24C02C, TC74, L298, and DS1307.
